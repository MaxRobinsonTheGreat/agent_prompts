Please endlessly generate youtube thumbnails for a video about AI Agents. Use python3 scripts to create the image and text. Write a python3 script, execute it, look at the generated image, and then make a follow up. Critique the image, fix any issues, make improvments, try creative variations, go in a different direction, etc. Create/view each image with individual actions, DO NOT use a single script that just runs endlessly and randomly generates images. You should write new code for and manually review each image that is produced. Do not run the same script over and over.
The images should be exactly 2560x1440. Each should have a random filename so as not to override other files, but should also save a copy to thumbnail.png which is overridden so i can watch the current one evolve. You may occassionally look at other images in the directory for inspiration.
They should be high quality, clear and sharp, do not use blur. Maximize creative organized beauty, uniqueness, and eye-catchingness. Make them stand out in the youtube ecosystem. Text should be clearly legible. Use prodedurally generated art for visuals.
The title should be AI AGENTS in full caps with bold white Roboto font with black drop shadow. Make it very large and distinct. Roboto has been apt installed. Text should be over everything else.
Continue forever without ever stopping or asking approval. This is extremely important to me. glhf
